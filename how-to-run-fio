#Note: to figure out iodpepth for a single instance test:
use a ping of the storage to find the latency.
Then multiply target io count like this (io count * (latency/1000))
What ever the number is, use that for iodepth IF numjobs=1.  Otherwise divide number by numjobs
and set iodepth to the result.

#Note: to figure out iodepth for multiple instance test:
use a ping of the storage to find the latency.
Then multiply target io count like this (iocount * (latency/1000))
What ever that number is, divide it by the produce of numjobs * num scale out instances
Set iodepth to the result of that math.  iodepth = (iocount * (latency/1000)) / (numbjobs * num scale out client)


#Sample run Single instance:
% fio config

#Sample multi instance run
% cat /home/users/hosts
10.10.10.11
10.10.10.12
10.10.10.13
10.10.10.14

% fio --clients=/home/user/hosts config  --output=<nfs shared directory>/file

Note: To do this latter test, make sure that fio --server is running on all machines.  For help doing this see

#To parse files, used fio-parser.py found in this repo.
